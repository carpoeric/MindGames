### Creator: Eric Carpo

> Welcome to MindGames! This is a collection of games that are designed to test your memory and reaction time. 
> The games are simple, but they can be quite challenging. The goal is to improve your cognitive skills and have fun at the same time.

## Games
>Classic Mode:
>> - You will have 10 tries to figure out the four-digit number combination I am thinking of with minimal hints! 
>> - Each guess should consist of any digits from 0-7 (none of my combos use 8 or 9!).
>> - If you're stumped, we can provide a hint that gives you one number in its correct location
> 
>Single Mind:
>> - You will have 10 tries to figure out the four-digit number combination I am thinking of. 
>> - Once you've made a guess, I will give you visual hints to help you figure out the correct combination.
>
>Double Trouble:
>> - If you're up for the challenge, try out Double Trouble! It's like Single Mind except with TWO combinations. Double the combo, double the fun! 
>> - Here you will have to guess two combinations at the same time, but you will have 12 tries to do so.

## Background
> Using Java as the primary coding language, I created this project to help people improve their cognitive skills. I believe that games are a great way to exercise your brain and have fun at the same time. 
> Additionally, I wanted to implement things in this project that would help me improve and showcase my coding skills. I learned a lot about Java and object-oriented programming while working on this project. I hope you enjoy playing these games as much as I enjoyed creating them.
